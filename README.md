# Optional Assignment
SOME CHANGES(LAB3)

During the lab I found a repository called **free-programming-books**. This repo is currently supported by Free Ebook Foundation. It contains a large list of free learning materials sorted by

- written language (32 languages available)
- programming language (includes the languages we study in this course)
- type of material (textbooks, online courses, podcasts, etc.)

#### Why I'm interested in it

1. I might use the materials for translation and contribute to the repo in the future
2. I might use the materials in the future for learning new languages 
3. Search for ideas for the project
